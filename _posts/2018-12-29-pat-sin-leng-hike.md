## Description

The Cloudy Hill-Wong Leng-Pat Sin Leng hike is a 7-hour hike for the experienced and energetic hiker looking for a good workout. This undulating section of the Wilson Trail meanders through eight iconic hills named after immortals in Chinese Mythology, views of Shenzhen, and the beautiful Tai Mei Tuk reservoir.

For a shorter 5-hour hike, opt for a starting route from Hok Tau. The path joins Wilson Trail past Hok Tau Reservoir.

True to its namesake, the Pat Sin Leng hike elevates hikers to the harsh realms of the gods. Those who are willing to brave the biting winds and precipitous slope will discover a path through stunning v-shaped valleys, panoramic views of Tai Po, and a newfound appreciation of natureâ€™s tranquility.

Follow signs to Cloudy Hill, Pat Sin Leng, and Tai Mei Tuk. The path is quite bare and windy, so make sure to bring enough water and sunscreen. Prepare a jacket, hat and gloves for chilly days.

## Trail surface

A good mix of paved and non-paved trail surface. Dirt paths for flatter areas, and rock or dirt steps for steeper sections. Be careful when walking on the steps held by wooden planks as some of the dirt has eroded and planks have become loose.
