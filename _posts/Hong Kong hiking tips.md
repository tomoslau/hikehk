# Hong Kong hiking tips

Must bring:

## Water

Hong Kong tap water isn't safe to drink, so make sure you boil plenty of water before the hike, or buy bottled water.

For a hot day, a good rule of thumb is one liter of water per hour of hike. You can find the approximate trail duration at the top of every guide. For example:

> Ma On Shan
>
> Hard · **5h** · 12.7km · Maclehose Trail Section 4

Equates to five liters of water as a safe amount you should bring to the hike if you're unsure of how much water you need. With more experience, you'll have a better idea of how much water you need to keep yourself hydrated.

## Hat

I recommend wearing a hat at all times to keep your skin cool, comfortable, and protected. It also helps to keep your face and glasses drier of it rains. I love hats made from nylon ripstop material, as they are durable, thinner, and easy to wash.

## Sunscreen

For hikes with plenty of sun exposure, sunscreen is recommended. It also depends on your sensitivity to sunburn. I myself rarely wear sunscreen as I don't mind getting mildly sunburnt and a light tan.

## Bug spray

Depends on how attractive your blood is.
