## Description

Maclehose Trail Section 7 is a hike along the ridges in Shing Mun Country Park. It begins at Shing Mun Reservoir and ends at Lead Mine Pass, through Needle Hill and Grassy Hill.

⚠ The ending point’s closest transport options are 1-2 hours walk away (Tai Po or Fo Tan marked in map.)

The hike offers serene views of Shing Mun Reservoir and the mountain ridges. On a clear day, views of West Kowloon and New Territories (from Tsuen Wan to Cheung Sha Wan,) and even the Ting Kau Bridge are visible from the climb to Needle Hill (532m.) On the opposite side, facing east, are views of Tai Wai and Sha Tin with a backdrop of mountains from earlier Maclehose sections, including Lion Rock.

Past Needle Hill, the trail continues north towards Grassy Hill at 647m. The climb to Grassy Hill is more gradual compared to Needle Hill. As the name suggests, Grassy Hill is quite grassy, and is home to plenty of cows. At higher elevations, enjoy the views of Tai Po, Fanling, Sheung Shui, and Lo Wu.

The decent from Needle Hill is consistent and gradual. The ridges continue towards Grassy Hill, a low gradient ascent to 647m. The descent from Grassy Hill is the steepest section of the hike, dropping quickly to 420m through continuous steps.

## Trail surface

The beginning section near Shing Mun Reservoir has an asphalt road surface with minimal gradient. Past the dam, the trail transitions into rock/concrete steps and dirt that are easy to hike. The climb up Needle Hill is mostly made of dirt and rock steps, supported by metal L brackets and vertical wooden planks.

During the descent, the path changes to asphalt with low gradient slopes. The asphalt surface continues throughout the ascent of Grassy Hill. The steep descent from Grassy Hill returns to dirt and rock steps.
