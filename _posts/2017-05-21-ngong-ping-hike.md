## Description

Lantau Trail Section 3 is a short hike around the north side of Ngong Ping. The trail offers views of the Ngong Ping village, including Tian Tan Buddha, from a high vantage point.

Make sure to also check out the Wisdom Path at the ending point of Section 3 and the beginning point of Section 4. The path is lined with 38 wooden monuments inscribed with the Heart Sutra prayer and created by Professor Jao Tsung-I. The columns are arranged in a figure-of-eight formation to symbolize infinity.

Past the village, the trail heads southwest along Ngong Ping Road. By the road is Shek Pik Viewing Point, a windy spot situated right above two cliffs. The trail continues down the road and ends at Sham Wat Road.
